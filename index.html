    <p id= "intro">My name is Diya Bhandarkar and I am a Senior at Fremont High School in Sunnyvale. At school, I am a member of the Key (Kiwanis) Club and Japanese Club at school. I am getting ready and prepared for college and want to major in either Computer Science or Creative Writing. I am currently living with my family, but have plans to save up enough money to be able to live on my own. Some things about me are that like to color and draw abstract art. I love writing books, as well as coding, designing, and playing video games, (anime) rpg ones in particular. I also enjoy reading books(of fantasy, adventure, etc.) and (light) novels. I can also play two instruments: piano and violin, but I'm better at piano. Despite these positives of me, I have few friends and don't believe in true love.</p>
